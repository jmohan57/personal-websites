# Pages Folder

## Overview

The "pages" folder is a fundamental part of your Next.js project structure. It houses the various pages and routes that comprise your portfolio website. Each file within this folder corresponds to a specific route, allowing you to create dynamic and SEO-friendly web pages effortlessly.


## Usage

The pages within this folder define the content and functionality of your portfolio website. By following Next.js conventions, you can create client-side-rendered and server-side-rendered pages with ease. These pages serve as the backbone of your website and are accessible through their respective routes.

Feel free to customize, extend, or create new pages to tailor your portfolio to your specific needs. You can also integrate components and assets from other folders within your project to build rich and engaging web pages.
