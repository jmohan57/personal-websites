# Components Folder

This folder houses essential components required to construct and display the content sections of your portfolio website. These components serve as building blocks for creating various sections, such as headers, project showcases, contact forms, and more. They are designed to be easily integrated into your website, providing flexibility and maintainability.
You can import and use these components within your portfolio website to structure and present content efficiently. These components act as foundational elements that allow you to create consistent and visually appealing sections without the need for extensive custom coding.

Feel free to expand and customize these components to suit your needs.
